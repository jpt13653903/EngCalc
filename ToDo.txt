Bugs:

ToDo:
- New version (2.0)
  - Use arbitrary precision floats and infinite precision rationals

Future Version Ideas:
- Resize
  - Both in width and height.
  - Resizing the input and output separately?
- From Steve S. (see "Meters to Feet and Fractional Inches " discussion on SourceForge)
  - Formula = "fix(x/0.3048)", "ft.,", "(x/0.3048 - fix(x/0.3048))*12", "in.",
    to get "32 ft., 9.7 in."
